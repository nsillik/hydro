# Goose Hints for Hydro Controller Project

## Project Context
This is a hydroponic controller project that manages and monitors hydroponic growing systems. It is written in Rust targeting the ESP32-C6 microcontroller.

## Technical Details
- This is a no_std embedded project (bare metal)
- Uses Embassy async runtime for task management
- Target architecture: RISC-V (riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf)
- Flash/deploy command: `espflash flash --monitor --chip esp32c6`
- Default log level is "info" (configured in .cargo/config.toml)

## Key Features & Capabilities
- WiFi connectivity (esp-wifi)
- Bluetooth Low Energy support (bleps)
- Network stack with TCP/IP (embassy-net + smoltcp)
- Custom heap allocation (72KB allocated)
- Hardware GPIO control
- Async task management

## Project Structure
- Main application logic in src/bin/main.rs
- Library code in src/lib.rs
- Core functionality implemented as async tasks
- Uses Embassy executor for task scheduling

## Common Operations
- WiFi and network stack initialization included
- Logging available via esp-println
- Error handling with esp-backtrace

## Development Notes
- Debug builds use size optimization (opt-level = "s")
- Release builds use full optimization with LTO
- Project includes both WiFi and BLE capabilities
- Embassy tasks should be spawned for concurrent operations
